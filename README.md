#Personal Heatmap#

Personal Heatmap uses a user's OpenPaths geolocation data to generate a heatmap that identifies the locations that he or she visits most often. It was built by [Mehan Jayasuriya](http://mehanjayasuriya.com/) using [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/), [Express](http://expressjs.com/), [heatmap.js](http://www.patrick-wied.at/static/heatmapjs/), HTML5, Canvas, JavaScript, [Node Oauth](https://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth), the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and the [Open Paths API](https://openpaths.cc/). Inspired, in part, by [Where Do You Go](http://www.wheredoyougo.net/).

Personal Heatmap was developed in [John Schimmel](http://www.base2john.com/)'s [Spring 2012 Dynamic Web class](http://itpwebclass.herokuapp.com/) at [NYU ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/). Many thanks to John for all of his help with the project.

To run this app locally, run 'npm install' and then 'node web.js'.

Personal Heatmap is in no way affiliated with OpenPaths or the New York Times Company.
